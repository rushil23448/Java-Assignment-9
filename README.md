# Bakery Simulation

This Java program simulates a small bakery where two bakers (represented by threads) are concurrently preparing cakes and cookies. Each baker announces when they start and finish baking each batch, with delays to simulate baking times.

## Description

The program creates two threads:
- **Cake Baker**: Bakes 5 cakes, each taking 1 second.
- **Cookie Baker**: Bakes 10 cookies, each taking 0.5 seconds.

This simulation demonstrates the use of Java threads in performing simultaneous tasks, which is analogous to real-world scenarios where multiple processes occur concurrently.

## Features

- Multithreading to simulate concurrent baking processes.
- Simple and clear console output for each step of the baking process.
- Use of thread sleep to simulate time delays in tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you run this program, make sure you have the following installed:
- Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or higher.
